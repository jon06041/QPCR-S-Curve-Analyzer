# Agent Instructions: Multi-Fluorophore qPCR Analysis - EXPERIMENT ISOLATION V2

## CURRENT STATUS (January 7, 2025 - RESTORED TO LAST KNOWN GOOD BRANCH)

### 🔄 TASK IN PROGRESS: Experiment Isolation Fix - Version 2

**Objective**: Implement robust experiment isolation to prevent cross-contamination between experiments
**Method**: Incremental, test-driven approach with proper branching and rollback capability
**Current Branch**: `fix/experiment-isolation-v2` (created from `fix-threshold-pathogen-tabs`)

#### 🎯 RESTORATION COMPLETED:
- **Restored from**: `fix-threshold-pathogen-tabs` (last known working state)
- **New branch**: `fix/experiment-isolation-v2` 
- **Database**: Fixed (28KB, proper permissions) - was 0 bytes in broken state
- **JavaScript**: No syntax errors detected
- **Previous work**: Safely stashed on `fix/experiment-isolation` branch

#### 📋 EXPERIMENT ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS:

**1. UI Component Isolation:**
- Results table shows only wells/channels for current experiment
- Chart displays only current experiment data
- Dropdown menus (well selection) contain only current experiment options
- Modals (well details, thresholds) operate only on current experiment data
- Control grids display only current experiment wells

**2. Cross-Experiment Contamination Prevention:**
- Loading a new experiment clears all UI components completely
- No data from previous experiments appears in any UI element
- Session storage maintains separation between experiment data
- Backend processing isolates experiments properly

**3. Multi-Channel vs Single-Channel Isolation:**
- Multi-channel experiments show all required channels (e.g., FAM, HEX, ROX, Cy5)
- Single-channel experiments show only the relevant channel
- Switching between experiment types properly updates all UI components

#### 🛡️ LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS ATTEMPT:

**❌ FAILED APPROACH - Centralized Filtering:**
- Implemented `applyExperimentIsolationFilter()` and `setFilteredAnalysisResults()`
- Applied filtering to all `currentAnalysisResults` assignments
- **Result**: Too aggressive - filtered out valid data, broke chart/UI completely
- **Error**: `window.amplificationChart is undefined` - chart never initialized

**❌ ROLLBACK ISSUES:**
- Simple revert didn't restore functionality
- Database became readonly/empty (0 bytes)
- Application remained broken even after code restoration

**✅ WORKING RESTORATION:**
- Full branch restoration to `fix-threshold-pathogen-tabs`
- Database restored to working state (28KB)
- Clean JavaScript with no errors
- Ready for incremental approach

#### 📋 NEW APPROACH - INCREMENTAL & TEST-DRIVEN:

**Phase 1: Investigation & Understanding**
1. ✅ Restore to known good branch (`fix-threshold-pathogen-tabs`)
2. ✅ Create new branch (`fix/experiment-isolation-v2`)
3. 🔄 Analyze current data flow and UI update patterns
4. 🔄 Identify specific contamination points
5. 🔄 Create test scenarios for validation

**Phase 2: Targeted Fixes**
1. Implement minimal, surgical changes to specific UI components
2. Test each change individually before proceeding
3. Focus on data source filtering rather than universal filtering
4. Maintain chart initialization and UI functionality

**Phase 3: Validation & Documentation**
1. Test all experiment switching scenarios
2. Verify no cross-contamination in any UI component
3. Document final solution and test protocols
4. Commit and merge when fully validated

#### 🔧 CRITICAL PROTOCOLS:

**ALWAYS BEFORE CHANGES:**
1. Create a new branch from last known good state
2. Document expected changes and test criteria
3. Test current functionality to establish baseline

**DURING IMPLEMENTATION:**
1. Make one small change at a time
2. Test immediately after each change
3. Commit working states, stash broken states
4. Never implement universal/global changes without targeted testing

**TESTING PROTOCOL:**
1. Upload a multi-channel experiment → verify all channels appear
2. Upload a single-channel experiment → verify only relevant channel appears  
3. Load previous multi-channel from history → verify no single-channel contamination
4. Load previous single-channel from history → verify no multi-channel contamination
5. Verify chart, table, dropdowns, modals, and control grids all work correctly

#### 📁 KEY FILES TO ANALYZE:

**Frontend (JavaScript):**
- `/static/script.js` - Main data flow, UI updates, filtering logic
- `/static/pathogen_library.js` - Defines required channels per experiment type

**Backend (Python):**
- `/app.py` - Session handling, experiment loading
- `/models.py` - Database schema, data structure
- `/sql_integration.py` - Database operations

**UI (HTML/CSS):**
- `/index.html` - UI structure, component definitions
- `/static/style.css` - Styling that affects component visibility

#### 🚨 ERROR MONITORING:

**Watch for these critical errors:**
- `window.amplificationChart is undefined` - indicates chart initialization failure
- `sqlite3.OperationalError: attempt to write a readonly database` - database permission issue
- Empty/missing dropdowns - indicates data filtering too aggressive
- Broken modals - indicates event handlers or data access issues

### 🎯 NEXT STEPS:

1. **Analyze Current Data Flow** - Trace how experiment data flows through the application
2. **Identify Contamination Points** - Find where previous experiment data persists
3. **Design Surgical Fixes** - Target specific UI update functions rather than global filtering
4. **Implement & Test Incrementally** - One component at a time with immediate validation
5. **Document & Commit Working Solution** - Full testing protocol and clean commit history

**Current Branch**: `fix/experiment-isolation-v2`  
**Database Status**: ✅ Working (28KB, proper permissions)  
**Application Status**: ✅ Functional (no JavaScript errors)  
**Ready for**: Incremental experiment isolation implementation

*Last updated: July 2, 2025 - Phase 2 Complete*
*Next Phase: Chart.js Optimization & User Experience Enhancement*

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions and findings from debugging and improving the multi-fluorophore (multi-channel) qPCR analysis workflow. The main goal was to ensure all channels (Cy5, FAM, HEX, Texas Red) are processed, combined, and displayed correctly.

## CURRENT STATUS (July 1, 2025 - Session End)
✅ **Multi-fluorophore processing**: COMPLETED - Sequential processing, error handling, threshold preservation
✅ **Control Grid CSS**: COMPLETED - Fixed both duplicate CSS and grid layout structure
✅ **Tabbed Grid Layout**: COMPLETED - Grid layout within tabs now works correctly
✅ **Single-Channel Test Support**: COMPLETED - Added support for all single-channel tests
� **Current Issue**: Thresholds not displaying - Backend vs Static Server mismatch
🔄 **Per-Channel Threshold System**: IN PROGRESS - Mathematical implementation added, needs debugging
🆕 **New Requirement**: CFX Manager-style baseline noise flattening for linear scale

## Control Grid CSS Issue - RESOLVED

### Root Cause Identified and Fixed
The issue was **incomplete test code support** in the grid system:

1. **Primary Issue**: Only 4 test codes (`BVAB`, `BVPanelPCR3`, `Cglab`, `Ngon`) were supported
2. **Missing Tests**: Single-channel tests (`Calb`, `Ctrach`, `Tvag`, `Mgen`, `Upar`, `Uure`) fell back to broken universal grid
3. **Fresh vs History**: History loads worked because they used cached grid data, fresh loads failed due to missing test support

### Solution Implemented ✅
✅ **Added Single-Channel Support**: All single-channel tests now supported in `showPathogenGridsWithData()`
✅ **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to identify test code detection issues
✅ **Cache Busting**: Updated cache-busting parameter to force CSS reload
✅ **Unified Grid Structure**: Both primary and fallback systems use same `.control-grid-table` structure

**Supported Test Codes Now:**
- **Multi-channel**: `BVAB`, `BVPanelPCR3`
- **Single-channel**: `Cglab`, `Ngon`, `Calb`, `Ctrach`, `Tvag`, `Mgen`, `Upar`, `Uure`

**Expected Layout:** ✅ NOW WORKING FOR ALL TESTS
```
| Control | Set 1 | Set 2 | Set 3 | Set 4 |
|---------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|    H    |  H1   |  H2   |  H3   |  H4   |
|    M    |  M1   |  M2   |  M3   |  M4   |
|    L    |  L1   |  L2   |  L3   |  L4   |
|   NTC   | NTC1  | NTC2  | NTC3  | NTC4  |
```

### Previous Problem Also Solved
Successfully identified and removed **two duplicate CSS sections** for control grids:

1. ✅ **Removed Section 1 (Lines 1112-1140)**: Duplicate `.pathogen-control-grid` with flexbox layout
2. ✅ **Removed Duplicate h5 styling (Line 1958)**: Redundant `.pathogen-control-grid h5` rules
3. ✅ **Kept Section 2 (Lines 2651+)**: Unified CSS Grid layout with proper structure

### Testing Required
- ✅ Control grid display consistency
- ✅ Fresh upload vs history load behavior  
- ✅ Multi-fluorophore tabbed interface displays correctly
- ✅ Control validation status indicators work
- ✅ Grid layout shows Set 1,2,3,4 as columns; H,M,L,NTC as rows
- ✅ All fluorophore tabs display proper grid layout

## Key Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Race Conditions in Channel Processing
**Problem**: Multiple fluorophore channels were being processed simultaneously, causing race conditions and inconsistent results.

**Solution**: Implemented sequential channel processing with `processChannelsSequentially()` function.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

### 2. Missing Threshold Values in History
**Problem**: Threshold values were not being preserved when loading from history or during multi-channel combination.

**Solution**: Enhanced `combineMultiFluorophoreResultsSQL()` to preserve threshold values and added validation.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

### 3. Inconsistent Backend Errors (400/404)
**Problem**: Random 400 and 404 errors during analysis due to network issues or timing problems.

**Solution**: Implemented `fetchWithRetry()` function with exponential backoff and comprehensive error handling.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

### 4. Incomplete Data Combination and Display
**Problem**: All four fluorophores were processed but not always combined or displayed correctly.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive debugging, data validation (`validateAnalysisDataQuality()`), and improved combination logic.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

## Key Functions Added/Modified

### Sequential Processing Functions
- `processChannelsSequentially(fluorophores, experimentPattern)`: Processes channels one by one
- `analyzeSingleChannel(fluorophore, experimentPattern)`: Handles individual channel analysis
- `displayChannelProcessingStatus(fluorophore, status, details)`: Shows real-time processing status

## HISTORICAL CONTEXT: Multichannel Processing Issue Analysis

### Original Problem Summary (June 30, 2025)

We had timing/completion issues with multichannel qPCR processing that affected both fresh loads and historical data retrieval. The current implementation didn't properly wait for all processes to complete before moving to the next step.

### Test Types Architecture
1. **Single Channel (Single Fluorophore)**: Tests 1 pathogen
   - Uses 1 of the 4 available machine channels for that specific test
   - Channel-pathogen mapping: 1:1 for the single pathogen being tested

2. **Multichannel (Multiple Fluorophores)**: Tests multiple pathogens simultaneously
   - **Machine Limitation**: Up to 4 channels (4 fluorophores) maximum per PCR machine
   - **Channel-Pathogen Mapping**: Each channel is grouped with a specific pathogen in that test
   - **Available Channels**: Same 4 machine channels, but within a test those channels are used with specific pathogens
   - **Sample Capacity**: Up to 384 wells per channel (368 samples + 16 controls = 384 total)
   - **Control Wells**: H, M, L, NTC controls used 4 times each = 16 control wells per channel
   - **Actual Sample Count**: 368 samples per channel (384 - 16 controls, or less for partial runs)
   - **Channel Definitions**: Each channel defined in `pathogen_library.js`

### Original Issues Identified

#### 1. Threshold Display Problems
- **Symptom**: Thresholds sometimes didn't show when loading from history
- **Suspected Cause**: Process didn't finish completely before moving to next step
- **Impact**: Charts displayed without proper threshold lines

#### 2. Control Grid Creation Issues
- **Symptom**: 
  - Fresh loads: Control grids had trouble displaying initially
  - History loads: All grids showed up properly on reopen
- **Details**: 
  - Multichannel tests create different tabs (up to 16 controls per pathogen/channel)
  - Control types: H (High), M (Medium), L (Low), NTC (No Template Control)
  - **Control Usage**: Each control type used 4 times = 16 control wells per channel
  - **Well Distribution**: 368 samples + 16 controls = 384 total wells per channel (or less for partial runs)
  - Grid layout varies by pathogen/channel

#### 3. Partial Channel Loading
- **Current Behavior**: Multichannel tests could load partial channel data
- **Database Behavior**: Partial results combine in DB, so full data available on reload
- **Problem**: Initial display incomplete, required history reload to see everything

### Root Cause Analysis
The core issue was **lack of proper transaction-like processing**:
- Processes ran asynchronously without proper completion waiting
- No guarantee that one channel completed before starting the next
- No final consolidation step that waited for all channels
- Frontend initiated combination while backend still processing individual channels

### Key Discovery: Control Extraction System Was Never Broken
The original control extraction functions were working correctly:
- ✅ `extractRealControlCoordinates()` - Works correctly with proper well data
- ✅ `isControlSample()` - Functions properly for control detection
- ✅ `createPathogenControlGrids()` - Real grid system (not dummy/fallback)

**The issue was data structure incompatibility, not the control extraction logic.**
- ❌ **Old Problem**: Fresh loads had incomplete well_id structure (missing fluorophore suffix)
- ✅ **Phase 2 Fix**: Well objects now have proper structure for both fresh and history loads
- ✅ **Result**: Original control extraction + fixed well objects = Working solution

### Implementation Phases Completed

#### ✅ Phase 1: Backend Channel Processing Tracking
- **Added**: `ChannelCompletionStatus` model in `models.py`
- **Features**: Tracked processing state, timestamps, validation flags
- **Methods**: `mark_channel_started()`, `mark_channel_completed()`, `mark_channel_failed()`
- **Backend API**: `/channels/processing-status/` and `/channels/processing/poll` endpoints
- **Frontend**: Channel status polling and progress display

#### ✅ Phase 2: Control Grid Fix & Polling Removal
**COMPLETED (July 1, 2025)**: Fixed control grid display issues and removed unnecessary polling

**Issues Fixed**:
1. **Control Grid Display**: 
   - ✅ Fixed fresh load well_id structure to match history loads
   - ✅ Ensured proper well_id construction with fluorophore suffixes (e.g., "A1_FAM")
   - ✅ Added coordinate field extraction from well_id for control grid
   - ✅ Enhanced debugging for control sample detection

2. **Data Structure Consistency**:
   - ✅ Made fresh loads return same structure as history loads
   - ✅ Proper JSON field parsing for database-loaded sessions
   - ✅ Ensured fluorophore and coordinate fields are always present

3. **Polling Removal**:
   - ✅ Removed unnecessary channel completion tracking
   - ✅ Cleaned up ChannelCompletionStatus polling endpoints
   - ✅ Simplified backend to focus on core functionality

#### ✅ Phase 3: Frontend Sequential Processing (COMPLETED)
**Current Status**: Replaced parallel channel processing with sequential queue

**Implementation Details**:
- **Old Problem**: Parallel processing caused race conditions
```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC: Parallel processing
fluorophores.forEach(async fluorophore => {
    const result = await analyzeData(data, fluorophore); // All start at once!
});
```

- **New Solution**: Sequential processing ensures proper completion
```javascript
// FIXED: Sequential processing  
for (const fluorophore of fluorophores) {
    await processChannelSequentially(fluorophore);
}
```

## CONTROL GRID CSS STYLING ISSUE - SOLUTION

### Problem Identified
Found **two duplicate CSS sections** for control grids:

1. **Section 1 (Lines 1112-1140)**: `.pathogen-control-grid` - Uses flexbox layout with fixed height (220px)
2. **Section 2 (Lines 2651-2680)**: `.pathogen-control-grid` - Uses CSS Grid layout with dynamic columns

### CSS Conflict Analysis
- **First Section** (1112): Designed for fluorophore stat card style grids
- **Second Section** (2651): Designed for dynamic grid layout with proper header structure
- **JavaScript Expectation**: Uses classes like `grid-header`, `grid-corner`, `control-cell` which match Section 2

### Recommended Solution
**Keep Section 2 (lines 2651+) and remove Section 1 (lines 1112-1140)**

**Reasoning**: 
- Section 2 has proper CSS Grid structure matching JavaScript expectations
- Includes dynamic column sizing with `data-sets` attributes
- Has comprehensive cell styling (valid/invalid/missing states)
- Supports the tabbed interface structure used by the pathogen grids

### Implementation Steps
1. Remove the first `.pathogen-control-grid` section (lines 1112-1140)
2. Keep the second section which has complete grid styling
3. Test control grid display after cleanup
4. Ensure both fresh uploads and history loads work correctly

### CSS Classes Used by JavaScript
From analysis, the JavaScript expects these CSS classes:
- `.pathogen-control-grid` - Main grid container
- `.grid-header` - Column headers
- `.grid-corner` - Empty corner cell
- `.control-cell` - Individual control cells
- `.valid`, `.invalid`, `.missing` - Validation state classes
- `.pathogen-tab-headers` - Tab navigation
- `.pathogen-tab-panel` - Tab content panels

## Chart.js Logarithmic/Linear Toggle Feature

### Current Implementation Status ✅ COMPLETED

- 🔄 **NEXT**: Address multi-view consistency (Show All Wells, POS, NEG, REDO) and per-channel threshold management

## CURRENT SESSION PROGRESS (July 1, 2025 - Final Documentation)

### 🚨 IMMEDIATE ISSUE: JavaScript Syntax Error + Threshold System
**Problem 1**: Script.js has unclosed brace causing syntax error (line ~1604)
**Problem 2**: User reports no threshold lines visible on charts
**Problem 3**: Channel information needs to be passed as objects with fluorophore property
**Status**: Partially implemented, CRITICAL fixes needed

#### Investigation Findings:
1. **Syntax Error**: MUST FIX FIRST - Script won't load due to unclosed brace
2. **Backend Mismatch**: User running static server (port 8000) but JS calls Flask backend (port 5002)
3. **Mock Backend Added**: Added `createMockAnalysisResponse()` for testing without Flask  
4. **Channel Structure Issue**: Channels passed as strings instead of objects with fluorophore property
5. **Missing Functions**: Added `updateMultiChannelThresholds()` and `updateSingleChannelThreshold()`

#### Key Code Changes Made This Session:
```javascript
// ADDED: Mock backend function for testing
function createMockAnalysisResponse(fluorophore) {
    const mockWells = {};
    // Creates realistic mock data structure with proper fluorophore property
}

// FIXED: Channel extraction in initializeChannelThresholds()
Object.keys(currentAnalysisResults.individual_results).forEach(wellKey => {
    const well = currentAnalysisResults.individual_results[wellKey];
    if (well && well.fluorophore) {
        channels.add(well.fluorophore); // Now uses fluorophore property
    }
});

// ADDED: Missing threshold annotation functions
function updateMultiChannelThresholds() { /* Implementation for all channels */ }
function updateSingleChannelThreshold(fluorophore) { /* Implementation for single channel */ }
```

#### Critical Next Steps (Priority Order):
1. **FIX SYNTAX ERROR**: Find and close unclosed brace in script.js around line 1604
2. **Test Basic Loading**: Ensure script.js loads without errors
3. **Test Threshold Display**: Run `python app.py` on port 5002 and test threshold lines
4. **Verify Channel Objects**: Ensure channels passed as objects with proper structure
5. **Complete Mathematical Calculations**: Test log/linear threshold algorithms

### 🆕 NEW FEATURE REQUEST: CFX Manager-Style Baseline Noise Flattening

**User Requirement**: 
> "I would like the ability to flatten baseline noise on the linear channel without affecting an s curve like the CFX Manager 3.1 does"

#### Technical Specification:
- **Target**: Linear scale view only (not logarithmic)
- **Behavior**: Flatten baseline noise in cycles 1-5 without affecting S-curve amplification
- **Reference**: CFX Manager 3.1 software functionality
- **User Control**: Toggle button to enable/disable baseline flattening
- **Preserve S-Curve**: Must not affect exponential amplification region (cycles 6-40)

#### Proposed Implementation Strategy:
1. **Baseline Detection Algorithm**:
   ```javascript
   function calculateBaseline(wellData) {
       // Extract RFU values from cycles 1-5
       const earlyCycles = wellData.raw_data.slice(0, 5);
       const baselineValues = earlyCycles.map(cycle => cycle.y);
       
       // Calculate baseline statistics
       const mean = baselineValues.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0) / baselineValues.length;
       const median = calculateMedian(baselineValues);
       
       return { mean, median, values: baselineValues };
   }
   ```

2. **Noise Flattening Algorithm**:
   ```javascript
   function applyBaselineFlattening(rawData, enableFlattening = false) {
       if (!enableFlattening) return rawData;
       
       const baseline = calculateBaseline({ raw_data: rawData });
       const flattenedData = rawData.map((point, index) => {
           if (index < 5) { // Only flatten cycles 1-5
               // Apply mathematical smoothing to reduce noise
               const smoothedValue = smoothBaseline(point.y, baseline);
               return { x: point.x, y: smoothedValue };
           }
           return point; // Preserve amplification region unchanged
       });
       
       return flattenedData;
   }
   ```

3. **UI Integration**:
   - Add toggle button to chart controls section (next to linear/log toggle)
   - Label: "Flatten Baseline Noise" with CFX Manager icon
   - Only visible/active when linear scale is selected
   - Real-time chart updates when toggled

#### Implementation Files to Modify:
- **`static/script.js`**: 
  - Add baseline flattening algorithms
  - Integrate with existing chart update system
  - Add toggle event handlers
- **`index.html`**: 
  - Add baseline flattening toggle to chart controls
  - Position near scale toggle for logical grouping
- **`static/style.css`**: 
  - Style baseline flattening toggle
  - Ensure consistent appearance with existing controls

#### Mathematical Approach Details:
```javascript
// Baseline smoothing algorithm (CFX Manager style)
function smoothBaseline(rfuValue, baseline) {
    // Apply weighted smoothing based on baseline statistics
    const noiseThreshold = baseline.mean + (2 * standardDeviation(baseline.values));
    
    if (rfuValue <= noiseThreshold) {
        // Apply aggressive smoothing to noise region
        return applyLowPassFilter(rfuValue, baseline.median);
    } else {
        // Light smoothing to preserve early amplification signals
        return applyMinimalSmoothing(rfuValue, baseline.mean);
    }
}
```

#### Testing Requirements:
1. **Noise Reduction**: Verify cycles 1-5 show reduced baseline variation
2. **S-Curve Preservation**: Ensure exponential amplification region unchanged
3. **Real-time Updates**: Toggle works immediately without page reload
4. **Scale Interaction**: Only available in linear mode, disabled in log mode
5. **Multi-Channel**: Works correctly for all fluorophore channels

### 📋 IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS FOR NEXT AGENT

#### Priority 1: Fix Threshold Display System
1. **Verify Chart.js Annotation Plugin**: 
   ```bash
   # Check if annotation plugin is loading
   # Look for console errors in browser dev tools
   # Verify script.js loads without runtime errors
   ```

2. **Test Backend Connection**:
   ```bash
   # Start Flask backend
   python3 app.py  # Runs on port 5002
   
   # OR use static server for testing
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   # Mock backend will activate automatically
   ```

3. **Debug Threshold Calculations**:
   ```javascript
   // Check in browser console after analysis:
   console.log('Channel Thresholds:', window.stableChannelThresholds);
   console.log('Current Analysis Results:', currentAnalysisResults);
   console.log('Chart Available:', !!window.amplificationChart);
   ```

#### Priority 2: Implement Channel Object Structure
**Current Problem**: Functions expect channel objects but receive strings

**Required Changes**:
```javascript
// CHANGE FROM:
['FAM', 'HEX', 'Cy5'].forEach(channel => {
    calculateChannelThreshold(channel, 'linear');
});

// CHANGE TO:
channelObjects.forEach(channelObj => {
    calculateChannelThreshold(channelObj, 'linear');
});
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `processChannelsSequentially()` - return channel objects
- `initializeChannelThresholds()` - accept channel objects
- All threshold calculation functions - use channelObj.fluorophore

#### Priority 3: Implement CFX Manager Baseline Flattening
**User Requirement**: "Flatten baseline noise on the linear channel without affecting an s curve"

**Implementation Plan**:
1. Add toggle button to chart controls (next to linear/log toggle)
2. Implement baseline detection algorithm (cycles 1-5 analysis)
3. Add noise flattening mathematical functions
4. Integrate with existing chart update system
5. Only activate in linear scale mode

**Code Structure**:
```javascript
// Add to chart controls
function addBaselineFlatteningToggle() {
    const chartControls = document.querySelector('.chart-controls');
    const toggle = createBaselineToggle();
    chartControls.appendChild(toggle);
}

// Implement flattening algorithm
function applyBaselineFlattening(rawData, enableFlattening) {
    if (!enableFlattenting) return rawData;
    // Apply CFX Manager-style noise reduction
}
```

### 🔍 DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

#### When Testing Threshold Display:
- [ ] Script.js loads without console errors
- [ ] Chart.js annotation plugin is registered
- [ ] `initializeChannelThresholds()` finds channels correctly

- [ ] S-curve amplification region unchanged
- [ ] Real-time updates work correctly

### 💻 COMPUTER SWITCH HANDOFF SUMMARY

**What's Working**:
✅ Multi-fluorophore sequential processing
✅ Control grid display system  
✅ Mock backend for testing without Flask
✅ Mathematical threshold calculations implemented
✅ Chart.js integration framework in place

**What Needs Immediate Attention**:
❌ Threshold lines not appearing on charts
❌ Channel object structure implementation
❌ CFX Manager baseline flattening feature
❌ Full threshold system debugging and testing

**Critical Files**:
- `static/script.js` - Main frontend logic (threshold system 80% complete)
- `Agent_instructions.md` - Complete documentation (THIS FILE)
- `app.py` - Flask backend with qPCR analysis
- `index.html` - UI structure (needs baseline toggle)

**Testing Approach**:
1. Start with Flask backend (port 5002) for full functionality
2. Fall back to static server (port 8000) for UI testing with mock data
3. Use browser dev tools to debug threshold calculations
4. Test with real qPCR CSV files for final validation

**Next Session Goals**:
1. Get threshold lines displaying correctly
2. Implement proper channel object passing
3. Add CFX Manager baseline flattening feature
4. Complete testing and validation of entire system
