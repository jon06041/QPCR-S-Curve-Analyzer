# Agent Instructions: Multi-Fluorophore qPCR Analysis Debugging

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive instructions and findings from debugging and improving the multi-fluorophore (multi-channel) qPCR analysis workflow. The main goal was to ensure all channels (Cy5, FAM, HEX, Texas Red) are processed, combined, and displayed correctly.

## Key Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Race Conditions in Channel Processing
**Problem**: Multiple fluorophore channels were being processed simultaneously, causing race conditions and inconsistent results.

**Solution**: Implemented sequential channel processing with `processChannelsSequentially()` function.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

### 2. Missing Threshold Values in History
**Problem**: Threshold values were not being preserved when loading from history or during multi-channel combination.

**Solution**: Enhanced `combineMultiFluorophoreResultsSQL()` to preserve threshold values and added validation.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

### 3. Inconsistent Backend Errors (400/404)
**Problem**: Random 400 and 404 errors during analysis due to network issues or timing problems.

**Solution**: Implemented `fetchWithRetry()` function with exponential backoff and comprehensive error handling.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

### 4. Incomplete Data Combination and Display
**Problem**: All four fluorophores were processed but not always combined or displayed correctly.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive debugging, data validation (`validateAnalysisDataQuality()`), and improved combination logic.

**Files Modified**: `static/script.js`

## Key Functions Added/Modified

### Sequential Processing Functions
- `processChannelsSequentially(fluorophores, experimentPattern)`: Processes channels one by one
- `analyzeSingleChannel(fluorophore, experimentPattern)`: Handles individual channel analysis
- `displayChannelProcessingStatus(fluorophore, status, details)`: Shows real-time processing status
- `updateChannelStatus(fluorophore, status, details)`: Updates UI status indicators

### Error Handling and Reliability
- `fetchWithRetry(url, options, maxRetries)`: Robust HTTP request handling with retry logic
- `validateAnalysisDataQuality(data, fluorophore)`: Validates analysis results for completeness

### Data Combination and Preservation
- Enhanced `combineMultiFluorophoreResultsSQL()`: Improved multi-channel combination with threshold preservation
- Re-enabled and improved combined session saving functionality

## Branch Management

### Current Branch Structure
- **fix/css-styling**: Contains the latest improvements and styling fixes
- **feature/multichannel-background-processing**: Contains the core multichannel processing logic
- **main**: Stable production branch

### Branch Synchronization Process
1. Commit changes to current branch
2. Switch to target branch
3. Merge latest changes
4. Push updated branches
5. Switch back to working branch

### Commands Used
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Descriptive commit message"
git checkout target-branch
git merge source-branch
git push origin target-branch
git checkout working-branch
```

## Debugging Strategy

### Comprehensive Logging Added
- Channel processing status tracking
- Data validation at each step
- Error capture and reporting
- Threshold value preservation logging
- Combination result verification

### Key Debug Points
1. **Pre-processing**: Validate input data and fluorophore list
2. **During Processing**: Track each channel's analysis progress
3. **Post-processing**: Verify data integrity and completeness
4. **Combination**: Ensure all channels are properly merged
5. **Display**: Confirm UI reflects all processed data

## File Locations and Key Code Sections

### static/script.js
- **Lines 10-100**: Sequential processing functions
- **Lines 367-400**: fetchWithRetry implementation
- **Lines 500-600**: Data validation functions
- **Lines 900-1000**: Main analysis workflow
- **Lines 1200-1400**: Multi-channel combination logic

## Testing and Validation

### Test Cases Verified
1. **Single Channel**: Each fluorophore processes correctly individually
2. **Multi-Channel**: All four channels process and combine properly
3. **Error Recovery**: System handles network errors gracefully
4. **History Loading**: Threshold values preserved when loading saved sessions
5. **UI Updates**: Real-time status updates work correctly

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **"Analysis failed" errors**: Check network connectivity and retry mechanism
- **Missing thresholds**: Verify combineMultiFluorophoreResultsSQL logic
- **Incomplete results**: Check sequential processing order
- **UI not updating**: Verify status update functions are called

## Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization
- Parallel processing causing race conditions
- Network errors causing complete failures
- Inconsistent data combination
- Missing threshold preservation

### After Optimization
- Sequential processing ensures data integrity
- Retry mechanism handles network issues
- Comprehensive error handling prevents cascading failures
- Robust data validation catches issues early

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Parallel Processing**: Could be re-enabled with proper synchronization
2. **Caching**: Implement result caching for repeated analyses
3. **Progress Bars**: More detailed progress indication for long analyses
4. **Error Recovery**: Automatic retry of failed channels only

### Maintenance Notes
- Monitor error logs for recurring issues
- Validate threshold preservation in new features
- Test multi-channel processing with each update
- Keep retry logic parameters tuned for optimal performance

## Configuration Parameters

### Retry Logic
- **maxRetries**: 2 (adjustable based on network conditions)
- **backoff**: Exponential (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **timeout**: 30 seconds per request

### Debug Logging
- **Level**: Comprehensive (can be reduced for production)
- **Output**: Console (can be redirected to file if needed)
