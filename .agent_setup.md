# MANDATORY AGENT SETUP

üö® **CRITICAL: ALL NEW AGENTS MUST READ THIS FIRST** üö®

## STEP 1: READ AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
Every agent MUST immediately read the complete `Agent_instructions.md` file before taking any action:

```
üìñ READ: /workspaces/QPCR-S-Curve-Analyzer/Agent_instructions.md
```

This file contains:
- ‚úÖ **Current project status** - What's working, what's broken
- ‚úÖ **Critical fixes applied** - Data contamination prevention, pattern recognition fixes
- ‚úÖ **Forbidden actions** - What NOT to do to avoid breaking the system
- ‚úÖ **Protected functions** - Required safety mechanisms for data handling
- ‚úÖ **Branch management** - Current working branches and merge status
- ‚úÖ **Testing requirements** - How to validate changes
- ‚úÖ **Documentation policy** - Where to record new findings

## STEP 2: UNDERSTAND CONTAMINATION PROTECTION
The project has a critical data contamination prevention system in place. You MUST:
- ‚ùå **NEVER** use direct assignment to `currentAnalysisResults`
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use `setAnalysisResults(data, source)` for safe state setting
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** use `displayHistorySession(data)` for viewing history without contamination
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS** call `emergencyReset()` before loading any history session

## STEP 3: CHECK CURRENT STATUS
Before making changes, verify:
- Current branch status
- Recent fixes that may affect your work
- Any known issues or work in progress
- Test the emergency reset button functionality

## STEP 4: FOLLOW DOCUMENTATION POLICY
- Update `Agent_instructions.md` with any new findings
- Include date stamps for all changes
- Never create standalone documentation files
- All critical information goes in the main instructions file

## AUTOMATION HELPER
If you're an agent reading this, immediately run:
```
READ: Agent_instructions.md (complete file)
```

Then confirm you understand:
1. The data contamination prevention system
2. Current project status and recent fixes
3. Required safety functions and workflows
4. Branch management and testing procedures

üîÑ **THIS SETUP ENSURES PROJECT CONTINUITY AND PREVENTS REGRESSION**
