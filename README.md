# qPCR S-Curve Analyzer

A web-based qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) S-Curve analyzer that processes CFX Manager CSV files and performs sophisticated sigmoid curve fitting to identify quality amplification patterns.

## Features

- **Upload CFX Manager CSV files** - Drag and drop interface for easy file handling
- **S-Curve Analysis** - Advanced sigmoid curve fitting using NumPy and SciPy
- **Quality Metrics** - R² score, RMSE, amplitude, steepness, and midpoint calculations
- **Interactive Visualization** - Chart.js powered curve displays
- **Variable Cycle Support** - Handles 30, 35, 38, 40, 45+ cycle runs
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identifies common qPCR curve problems
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Recent Updates (June 2025)

✅ **Critical NumPy dependency issue resolved**  
✅ **384-well plate support confirmed**  
✅ **Variable cycle count processing (30-45+ cycles)**  
✅ **Stable deployment configuration**  

## 🔥 ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT STATUS (January 2025)

**Current Task**: Refactoring qPCR S-Curve Analyzer control grid display and multichannel processing

### ✅ Completed (Latest Session)
- Removed all legacy/fallback grid logic and dummy control systems
- Fixed well_id construction for fresh loads to match history loads format
- Enhanced control sample detection with defensive programming
- Disabled unnecessary polling endpoints to prevent 400 errors
- Updated CSS isolation testing for control grid display
- Pushed changes to GitHub and created feature branch

### 🚨 Current Issues
- **Multichannel Analysis**: 400 errors from `/analyze` endpoint after polling removal
- **Control Grid CSS**: Need to finalize which CSS section controls the grid display
- **Sequential Processing**: Multichannel needs sequential rather than parallel processing

### 🎯 AGENT INSTRUCTIONS & DEBUGGING GUIDE
**REFER TO**: `/workspaces/QPCR-S-Curve-Analyzer/Agent_instructions.md` for comprehensive debugging guide and multi-fluorophore processing documentation

**✅ COMPLETED FIXES**:
1. ✅ Fixed multichannel analysis 400 errors with fetchWithRetry implementation
2. ✅ Implemented sequential multichannel processing (processChannelsSequentially)
3. ✅ Added comprehensive error handling and data validation
4. ✅ Fixed threshold value preservation in history and combination
5. ✅ Enhanced debugging with detailed logging throughout the pipeline
6. ✅ Synchronized code across branches (fix/css-styling & feature/multichannel-background-processing)

**KEY IMPROVEMENTS**:
- Sequential channel processing eliminates race conditions
- Robust error handling with retry logic and data validation
- Comprehensive debugging and status tracking
- Threshold preservation in multi-channel combinations
- Branch synchronization and documentation  

## Quick Start

### Railway Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Set environment variables:
