# qPCR S-Curve Analyzer

A web-based qPCR (quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction) S-Curve analyzer that processes CFX Manager CSV files and performs sophisticated sigmoid curve fitting to identify quality amplification patterns.

## Features

- **Upload CFX Manager CSV files** - Drag and drop interface for easy file handling
- **S-Curve Analysis** - Advanced sigmoid curve fitting using NumPy and SciPy
- **Quality Metrics** - RÂ² score, RMSE, amplitude, steepness, and midpoint calculations
- **Interactive Visualization** - Chart.js powered curve displays
- **Variable Cycle Support** - Handles 30, 35, 38, 40, 45+ cycle runs
- **Anomaly Detection** - Identifies common qPCR curve problems
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Recent Updates (June 2025)

âœ… **Critical NumPy dependency issue resolved**  
âœ… **384-well plate support confirmed**  
âœ… **Variable cycle count processing (30-45+ cycles)**  
âœ… **Stable deployment configuration**  

## ðŸ”¥ ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT STATUS (January 2025)

**Current Task**: Refactoring qPCR S-Curve Analyzer control grid display and multichannel processing

### âœ… Completed (Latest Session)
- Removed all legacy/fallback grid logic and dummy control systems
- Fixed well_id construction for fresh loads to match history loads format
- Enhanced control sample detection with defensive programming
- Disabled unnecessary polling endpoints to prevent 400 errors
- Updated CSS isolation testing for control grid display
- Pushed changes to GitHub and created feature branch

### ðŸš¨ Current Issues
- **Multichannel Analysis**: 400 errors from `/analyze` endpoint after polling removal
- **Control Grid CSS**: Need to finalize which CSS section controls the grid display
- **Sequential Processing**: Multichannel needs sequential rather than parallel processing

### ðŸŽ¯ NEXT AGENT INSTRUCTIONS
**REFER TO**: `/workspaces/QPCR-S-Curve-Analyzer/MULTICHANNEL_PROCESSING_ISSUE.md` for complete analysis log

**IMMEDIATE TASKS**:
1. Debug and fix multichannel analysis 400 errors
2. Complete CSS testing to identify correct control grid styles
3. Implement sequential multichannel processing (Phase 3)
4. Test both single and multichannel runs end-to-end

**KEY INSIGHT**: Original control extraction system works with new well object structure - focus on multichannel timing issues, not grid logic.  

## Quick Start

### Railway Deployment
1. Connect your GitHub repository to Railway
2. Set environment variables:
   ```
   FLASK_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```
3. Railway will automatically detect and run `simple_app.py`

### Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install flask numpy scipy matplotlib scikit-learn pandas

# Run the application
python simple_app.py
```
