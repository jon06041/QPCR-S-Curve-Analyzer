Final Status Report - What was actually fixed
"""

print("=== ACTUAL FIXES APPLIED ===\n")

print("1. BVAB Fallback Issue:")
print("   ✅ Removed hardcoded BVAB fallback mapping from getPathogenMappingForTest()")
print("   ✅ Function now returns empty object when test not found in pathogen library")
print("   ✅ No more automatic loading of BVAB grids for unknown tests")

print("\n2. Threshold Value Saving Issue:")
print("   ✅ Added propagateThresholdsToWells() call before saveCombinedSessionToDatabase()")
print("   ✅ Ensures threshold values are propagated to all wells before saving")
print("   ✅ Backend already had threshold_value saving logic in save-combined endpoint")
print("   ✅ Database schema already supports threshold_value column")

print("\n3. Session Saving Infrastructure:")
print("   ✅ save-combined endpoint exists and handles multichannel sessions")
print("   ✅ Database commits and rollback handling in place")
print("   ✅ Threshold values included in well_results table")

print("\n=== REMAINING ISSUES TO TEST ===")
print("1. Upload a multichannel CSV file and verify:")
print("   - Session saves successfully")
print("   - Threshold values appear in database")
print("   - Control grids show correct test type (not BVAB)")
print("   - No browser refresh interruption")

print("\n2. Check that single channel uploads still work properly")

print("\n=== FILES MODIFIED ===")
print("- static/script.js: Added threshold propagation before session saving")
print("- static/script.js: Removed BVAB fallback from getPathogenMappingForTest()")
print("- Removed unused pathogen_grids.js (kept pathogen_grids_data.js)")

print("\nThe core infrastructure fixes are in place. Test with actual file uploads.")
